What is this?

Hopefully a few others will join this group. I just played around with the grid beta (app.thegrid.io) and personally thought it was terrible and confusing as hell to use. Posts I published didn't show up, ones I did looked terrible. I don't see any premade templates, or ecommerce support. Very little customization...basically it just seems like a bad rip off of[medium.com][0]with very bad UI/UX.
